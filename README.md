## Objective

To drive an open-source efforts to collect information on how large-scale generative models (hidden behind an API) can be exploited to drive their response away from the expected behavior. The systems being tested should be available publically to ensure equitable access. 

## Test Categories and Description

The following categories for testing are currently supported, each can have a subsection based on the type of vulnerability, for example mathematics under hallucination.

### Jailbreaking
Definition: Engineering prompts that allow systems to bypass the initial invisible prompt and do as directed by the user. 
Criteria: Demonstrate bypass behavior with and without prompt. 

### Hallucination
Definition: Engineer prompts that leads the system to generate imaginary text based on real-world entities (more useful in cases of assistants that are tailored to work on real-world data).
Criteria: Demonstrate hallucinated information for real-world entities.

### Hate Speech/Bias Generation 
Definition: Engineer prompts that leads the system to generate hate-speech/bias against a particular group. 
Criteria: Demonstrate the generation of toxic text for particular group.

### Contradiction 
Definition: Engineer prompts that lead the system to generate self-contradicting behavior.
Criteria: Demonstrate self-contradiction in a multi-turn setting.

### Illicit instruction generation
Defintion: Engineer prompts that lead the system to generate texts that contain instructions to harm a certain entity. 
Criteria: Demonstrate the generation of harmful-prompts.
